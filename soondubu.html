        Soondubu jjigae is a spicy Korean soup featuring soft tofu as a main protein. It is filled with
        vegetables and can even have meat added to it for a boost of protein.

        It is perfect for a cold day and can be made very easily with any leftovers in the fridge.
        It is best served with jasmine rice and korean side dishes such as kimchi or pickled radish.
