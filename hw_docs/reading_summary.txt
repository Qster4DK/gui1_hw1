Starting with the front-end roadmap, people who are working in front-end are known as front-end developers, front-end engineers, front-end web developers, JavaScript Developers,
HTML/CSS Developer, front-end web engineers, and front-end web architects. Each position has similar work and requires many of the same front-end development skills.
But there are differences in the levels of experience and expertise in the different front end development skills.
The main two languages that are important to learn for front-end development are HTML and CSS. Getting a head start on those two languages will allow the mastery of them early on.
The earlier the better. When beginning to use HTML and CSS, creating simple projects will help learn the basics of those languages. After HTML and CSS, learning JavaScript,
Git, and GitHub will help get an entry level front-end development position. Front-end developers also make a good amount of money since the average salary is around $80k a year.
In the full stack developer reading, full stack development combines both front-end and back-end aspects of web application development.
A full stack developer can work on any layer of a software application, including the user interface, the user experience, the server, database, and server-side logic.
Knowing every layer of developing a software application allows full stack developers to create projects independently or part of a team.
